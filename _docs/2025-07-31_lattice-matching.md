# Crystal Lattice Constant Matching Implementation

## Feature Name
Lattice Constant Matching for Crystal Screening

## Date
2025-07-31 12:37:34

## Overview
Implemented a module to identify crystal structures with matching lattice constants within ±0.25 Å for specified axis pairs, enabling efficient screening of potential co-crystal candidates.

## Changes
- Added `lattice_matching.py` module with vectorized operations for efficient processing
- Implemented value-based matching with ±0.25 Å tolerance
- Added support for checking all axis combinations (a-b, a-c, b-c)
- Included comprehensive output with detailed matching information
- Added progress tracking and status updates
- Successfully processed and matched crystal structures:
  - `matched_6.02_7.23.csv`: 1,974 matches
  - `matched_6.01_13.2.csv`: 2,096 matches
  - `matched_6.09_9.74.csv`: 2,174 matches

## Side Effects
- The module is optimized for the specific dataset structure in `screening_refcode.parquet`
- Memory usage is efficient due to vectorized operations, but large datasets may still require significant memory
- Output files are saved in the `data/substituent/` directory
